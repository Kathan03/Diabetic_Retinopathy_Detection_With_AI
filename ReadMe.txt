Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using ResNet18

The project covers development of a Diabetic Retinopaty Detection system using Resnet18 model. The overall obtained classiciation test accuracy is 82%. Here, I have tried to build the ResNet18, basic building block from scratch using Keras.

ResNet18 consists of a total of 18 layers, including 17 convolutional layers and 1 fully connected layer. It is composed of basic building blocks called residual blocks, which contain two convolutional layers along with skip connections. These skip connections enable the network to learn residual mappings effectively.
